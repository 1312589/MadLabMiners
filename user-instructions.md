How to build a float
====================

1. Think of an idea for what to build for your float
2. Queue up and find a free computer
3. Ask one of the volunteers to show you how to get started
4. Have fun building your float inside the rectangular box -- if you get stuck just ask for help
5. When your float is finished ask one of the volunteers to write down your name so we know who has which float
6. Push the button to send the float into the parade on the big screen
