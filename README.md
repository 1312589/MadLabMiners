This repository is for planning and code related to the Minecraft/Minetest group at MadLab.

Next Meeting:  13th September 2015

Outline Plan
------------

Just starting planning for the next CoderDojo.  Dave P is going to investigate if we can follow the [Nand to Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) course using Minetest and the logic gates in Mesecons.

As a secondary idea we could make the logic gates from dominos also:  https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1024
