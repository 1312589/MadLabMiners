MadLab Miners
=============

This repository is for planning and code related to the Minecraft/Minetest group at MadLab.

Next Meeting:  14th June 2015 -- The Manchester Day Parade
===========================

Outline Plan
------------

We have the Manchester Day Parade coming up on Sunday 14th June.  We have space in the Manchester Library on the day.  The CoderDojo on the 10th of May is the last one before the parade.  The plan for 10th May is to try out some of the things that we will do on the parade day.

### Probably Achievable Things
* Build a float to go into the parade
* Capture the float in some way that it can be added to the server which is displaying all the floats (e.g. https://github.com/Uberi/Minetest-WorldEdit )
* Implement a server that shows all the floats in the parade -- project up on to the wall

To-do List
----------

2. Implement the client world/code that will have a defined area in which to build your float, have a button to save your float out some how, finally reset the world so that the next person can build a float
3. Implement the server to display all the floats and some how animate them going past
4. Implement the code to add the saved floats into the parade
5. Implement some code to handle what happens when you get too many floats in the parade


Done List
----------
1. Add the WorldEdit mod to the CoderDojo game pack
