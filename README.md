MadLab Miners
=============

This repository is for planning and code related to the Minecraft/Minetest group at MadLab.

Next Meeting:  13th September 2015
===========================

Outline Plan
------------

Just starting planning for the next CoderDojo.  Dave P is going to investigate if we can follow the [Nand to Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) course using Minetest and the logic gates in Mesecons.

As a secondary idea we could make the logic gates from dominos also:  https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1024

To-do List
----------

* Document truth tables for:
    * NAND
    * NOT
    * AND
    * OR
    * MUX
    * DMUX
    * NOT16
    * AND16
    * OR16
    * MUX16
    * OR8WAY
    * MUX4WAY16
    * MUX8WAY16
    * DMUX4WAY
    * DMUX8WAY
* Intro page on the wiki
* Look at how to do the dominos
* See if we can buy some dominos from the Mcr CoderDojo fund
* Think how we get everyone working in groups for this
* Think if there is some building element we can incorporate
* See how hard it would be to build additional mods to Mescons with more logic components
    * Do Minetest mods already exist with more compoents
